		<h2>JPG</h2>
		<p>They are designed for handling pictures with large color palettes without greatly increasing the size of files. This makes them great for pictures with gradients. On the other hand theyh do not support images with transparent backgrounds.</p>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<img src="./images/mochi.jpg">
		
		<h2>GIFs</h2>
		<p>They are used for simple animations but have limited palette options. Transparency is a "binary option" thus making semi-opaque images low quality.</p>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<img src="./images/mochi.gif">

		<h2>SVG</h2>
		<p>They are Scalable Vector Graphics. This means that pixels are drawn based on vector coordinate instead of a bitmap. This allow the quality of the image to be retained regardless of the zoom.</p>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<img src="./images/mochi.svg">

		<h2>PNG</h2>
		<p>They can do what JPG can and can also handle varying opacity just well but the are considerably larger than their JPG equivalents</p>
		<h3>Example</h3>\
		<img src="./images/mochi.png">
